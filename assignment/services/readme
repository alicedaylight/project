Alice Day's Project Proof of Concept

I want to create a purposeful sap that I can see myself using and updating outside of my webDev project.
I am drawing my inspiration from https://shophrh.co/ which is a website that sells handmade jewelery in
addition to lifestyle-blogging from the jewelery designer.


My project is a sap that sells new or gently used makeup. The two types of users are seller(admin) and buyers.
Anonymous users will be able to view products that are being sold and search the websites by makeup category like
base, eyes, lips, cheeks, hair. To make purchases, read reviews, or follow other users, they will need to make an
account.

Buyers can follow other buyers and will be notified if the other buyer makes a purchase or writes a review.
Buyers will also have in inbox and be alerted of make products that are going on sale for a discounted price. Discount
codes will be given out to new users and can be applied to a buyer's first purchase. Once a buyer has added a
product to their cart, it will remain in the cart until they proceed to check out.

Seller(s) will have total access to the site; they can remove a product, update the price or a product, and add
new products. Sellers can also delete users who have violated the sites policy.

I plan on using the creative or stylish portfolio template and also font awesome.

The problem I am trying to solve is: I have a lot of makeup that I have never used or used one time and not have
a purpose for. Many second online stores that sell second hand or new products charge a large fee (up to 20%) of
the price of the item and a shipping fee. As a result, sellers barely make a profit and buyers end up paying a
larger fee than they need to. By creating my own site to allow other users to purchase my makeup produts, I have
a lot of control over my profit.

I plan on using the API's of the various social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube so that
buyers can connect with each other
